          Greetings! I'm Yordanos Lemmawork, a passionate Software Engineer dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology to solve real-world challenges. I find inspiration in crafting innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives.
          My journey in software engineering began with a desire to create, learn, and grow. I've had the privilege of gaining a solid foundation in this field, thanks to  Holberton School. At Holberton, I immersed myself in the world of coding, algorithms, and problem-solving. It was here that I realized the immense potential of technology to shape the future.
